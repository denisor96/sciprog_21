This weeks practical contains one exercises, requiring one  program.

hanoi.c

- This program shows how to complete the Tower of Hanoi Puzzle for a given number of disks.
- This program requires one inputs, an integer n which is the number of disks in the tower

- There is one subfunction in this program hanoi(n,  source,  dest,  mid).
- n is the number of disks and source, dest and mid are also integers, distinct values representing the the three tower, in this case 1, 2 and 2 respectively.
- This function performs the entire solution for the tower of hanoi solution and prints every step for each disk
- This function does not return any value.

- In the main function n is input by the user and hanoi(n , 1, 3, 2) is called.
- The program is then terminated.
