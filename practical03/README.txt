This weeks practical contains one exercise comprising of one file

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
traprule.c
- This program requires no input from the user
- This c file calculates the area under the curve of tan(x) from 0 to pi/3 (in radians) using the trapezoidal rule.
- It also calculates the exact value for this area under the curve of tan(x) from 0 to pi/3 (in radians) which conveniently is log(2).
- This function creates 11 equidistant points between the beginning and end values and prints the x an y values for each increment.
- It gets f(xi) for each point from x0 (0) to x12 (pi/3)
- It then sums the values as per the function and applies the (b-a)/N factor to generate the trapexoidal rule estimate.
- Finally, it prints both values for the area under the curve and the difference between the two.
