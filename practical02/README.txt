This weeks practical contained two exercises, each requiring its own function.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conversion.C
- This program requires no input from the user
- This function in centred around an integer value inum, declared and assigned a given value in the function.
- The function then converts it to differenct forms i.e. float, binary (as a string) and number of digits
- The function prints the output of the conversions
- To see the conversion of other values the user needs to manually assign inum a different value in the code

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sum.C
- This program requires no input from the user
- This function generates two floats, sum1 and sum2
- These numbers are the sum of series i.e. sum1 = sum1 + most recent iteration of the series
- The series for sum1 is a decreasing series over i. Each increment is a float = 1/i
- The series for sum1 is an increasing series over i. Each increment is a float = 1/i
- Each series has the same number of iterations = 1000
- For sum1, i begins at 1 and increases by 1 for each iteration until is reaches 1000
- For sum2, i begins at 1000 and decreases by 1 for each iteration until is reaches 1  
- To change the range it is summed over, the user needs to manually change the condtions of both for loops appropriately
